The results I found were mostly in line with my expectations. The main
thing I found surprising was how low (relatively) the salaries of data
scientists were. I think many of the disparities between how much we
think a certain profession makes and how much the median income actually
is can be explained by the prescence of outliers in the data. Additionally,
the dataset groups similar jobs together in one entry, even though the
specifics like income could be very different between similar but 
distinct jobs.

I would rank my top three choices as 1. Software Developer, 2. Computer
Scientist, 3. Data Scientist. I think these jobs pay reasonably well 
and also are jobs that I meet the requirements for.
